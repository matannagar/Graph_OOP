## **About this project**
This project represents a game that is based on the implementation of an directional weighted graph with different methods and algorithms.

## **Pokemons Game**
In this game the goal is to collect as many pokemons as possible through one or more of your pokeballs.<br />
The game has few different scenarios, based on different graphs with different time limits, in various levels.<br />
The pokemons remain static in their places and have different values. one pokemon can be more valuable than the other.

***The pokeballs-*** <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/HxbVLvs/pu.png" alt="pu" border="0"></a> <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Z1Y8RLb/re.png" alt="re" border="0"></a><a href="https://imgbb.com/"> <img src="https://i.ibb.co/CQ5qMv4/yel.png" alt="yel" border="0"></a><br />

The pokeballs are our players and the more they catch pokemons the more value they gain.<br />
They can also increase their speed if they catch enough pokemons.<br />


***The pokemons-*** there are two types of them:
- Picachua <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/F6nJSmp/Webp-net-resizeimage-1.png" alt="Webp-net-resizeimage-1" border="0"></a> 
- Balbazor <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/zQS7Hd0/balb.png" alt="balb" border="0"></a>  

Our game is connected to a server that provides the arenas as a JSON file converted into a string.

## Our Packages & Classes:

**api:**
* directed weighted graph- this is the data structure that base this game on.
* directed weighted graph algorithms- these are the main functions used to create the arena (load, save, init) and also responsible for finding the path from each pokeball to a pokemon
* Ex2- In order to start playing the game you need to run this class, which is responsible for the initial of the arena, pokemons and pokeballs.


**GameClient**
* util- This folder contains the classes which are responsible for the game's graphics (Using Jframe & JPanel).
* Arena- The arena is based on a directed weighted graph and includes the pokaballs and the pokemons.
* CL_Pokemon- Class representing the pokemon object.
* CL_Agent- Class representing the agent object.

**Data:**
* In this folder you will find the graphs files and the elements images for the graphical presentation.

## **Main algoritms to construct the game**
- ***shortestPathDist-*** return the length of the shortest path between source vertex to the target vertex.
- ***shortestPath-*** return the shortest path between source vertex to the target vertex- as an ordered list of nodes:
*source--> n1--> n2--> ... -->target*

## **Dijkstra's algorithm**
In the development of the algorithm of shortestPath in the weighted graph, we based on Dijkstra's algorithm,<br />
in order to find the quickest path from a pokeball to a pokemon.

## **To clone this repository**
Write in your Git Bash the follow:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Reut-Maslansky/ex2.git
```
## To run this game
Download the jar file and data folder and put them in the same folder.
1. Open this folder in the cmd and run this command line :
```
java -jar Ex2.jar <ID Number> <Scenario Number> 
``` 
2. Click twice on the jar file. This will open a login window where you will be required to fill ID number and a scenario of a chosen game.
Make sure you enter a valid scenario game number and ID.
Finally, press start!
