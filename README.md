# **OOP-Ex1: Weighted Graph**

## **About this project**
This project represents an implementation of an undirectional unweighted graph with different methods and algorithms.

## **Main algoritms:**
- isConnected- return if there is a valid path from every vertex to each other vertex in the graph.
- shortestPathDist- return the length of the shortest path between source vertex to the target vertex.
- shortestPath- returns the the shortest path between source vertex to the target vertex-
      as an ordered List of nodes: source--> n1-->n2-->...target
- save- saves this weighted (undirected) graph to the given file name.
- load- load a graph from the given file name to to a graph  on which We'll operates the algorithms above.

## **Dijkstra's algorithm**
In the development of the algorithm of shortestPath in the weighted graph I base on Dijkstra's algorithm.
