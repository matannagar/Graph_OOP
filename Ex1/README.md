# **OOP-Ex1: Weighted Graph**

## **About this project**
This project represents an implementation of an undirectional unweighted graph with different methods and algorithms.

## **Main algoritms:**
- ***isConnected-*** return if there is a valid path from every vertex to each other vertex in the graph.
- ***shortestPathDist-*** return the length of the shortest path between source vertex to the target vertex.
- ***shortestPath-*** return the shortest path between source vertex to the target vertex- as an ordered list of nodes:
*source--> n1--> n2--> ... -->target*
- ***save-*** saves this weighted graph to the given file name.
- ***load-*** load a graph from the given file name to to a graph on which We'll operates the algorithms above.

## **Dijkstra's algorithm**
In the development of the algorithm of shortestPath in the weighted graph, I base on Dijkstra's algorithm.
